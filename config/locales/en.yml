  more_information_text_4: "The interactions takes the form of a conversation. The objects are curious about the world they find themselves in and want to ask questions about it. The responses they receive are then shared with other players meaning an object understands the personality and people of the local area."
  more_information_text_5: "Conversations await in downtown Mesa, get chatting with the 32 street landmarks now through April 15. See if you can find them all!"
