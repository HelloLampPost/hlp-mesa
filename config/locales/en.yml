  information: "About Hello Lamp Post"
  information_title: "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to talk to the city that you live in?"
  information_text: "Around the world, cities have been waking up and talking to their residents (Japan, Singapore, UK, Kazakhstan, France and the USA). Now 4 cities across India are coming to life and want to learn everything there is to know about their residents stories and connections with the UK. e.g. Where is everyone rushing off to in the mornings? Where are the best places to meet friends and hang out? What was here before? What are everyone’s dreams for the future? (Examples need changing)"
  infomation_text_2: "From the 10th of August until the 31st, you will be able to talk to your local neighbourhood (and all the others around the city) and also learn what your neighbours also have to say."

  more_information_text_1: "If you look closely, most street objects have a manufacturer or maintenance reference code on them. These codes are used by operators to distinguish one object from another. Hello Lamp Post gives a new use to these existing codes by allowing localised conversations in public spaces."
  more_information_text_2: "You can have a chat with any object - drain covers, bins, public toilets, utility boxes, trees and bike stations."
  more_information_text_3: "The interaction takes the form of a conversation. The objects are curious about the world they find themselves in and want to ask you questions about it. The response they receive are then shared with other players meaning an object understands the personality and people of the local area."
  more_information_text_4: "Conversations can be started from any mobile phone that sends text (SMS) messages. It’s free to play (standard SMS and data rates apply) and it’s suitable for all ages."
